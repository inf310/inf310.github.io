## Networking

- **Protocol**: a set of data formats and rules for communication
- **Bandwidth**: the total capacity of a connection (Gb/s)
- **Throughput**: the amount of data a node can process (Gb/s)
- **Latency**: the amount of time a client waits for a response (seconds)

---

## HTTP

- Text-based
- Request-Response model
- Intended for simple document retrieval
- Limitations have led to many workarounds

---

## HTTP/2

- Faster and smarter (binary encoding)
- Two-way communication
- Eliminates head-of-line blocking
- Breaks many hacks around http 1.1

---

## SSL: Secure Socket Layer

- attacker cannot read messages
- attacker cannot change message
- guaranteed through certificates

---

## Front-end evolution

- **Static Web sites**: html only, reload on action
- **AJAX Web sites**: background data processing
- **SPA**: single page applications

---
## The browser

- has been evolving for over 20 years
- mostly open, transparent and easy-to-use
- protects multiple interests on a page
- provides a built-in development environment

---

## Front-end technologies

- **HTML**: content and structure
- **CSS**: styling and presentation
- **JavaScript**: interactivity
- **Browser APIs**: multiple functionalities

---

## Back-end evolution

- **Static web server**: returns files from disk
- **CGI Protocol**: run a program to generate a response
- **Application Server**: language specific implementations
- **Serverless**: execute code on shared cloud infrastructure
